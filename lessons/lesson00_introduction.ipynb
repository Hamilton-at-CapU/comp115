    "## Who Is This Course For?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn to program, you have come to the right place.  Python is one of the best programming languages for beginners -- and it is also one of the most in-demand skills.  Not only is Python great for beginners, it has been ranked the most popular coding language since 2022 in the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You have also come at the right time, because learning to program now is probably easier than ever.\n",
    "With virtual assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini, you don't have to learn alone.\n",
    "Throughout this course, you'll learn ways you can use these tools to accelerate your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is primarily for people who have never programmed before and people who have some experience in another programming language.  If you have substantial experience in Python, you might find the first few chapters too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of learning to program is that you have to learn *two* languages: one is the programming language itself; the other is the vocabulary we use to talk about programs.\n",
    "If you learn only the programming language, you are likely to have problems when you need to interpret an error message, read documentation, talk to another person, or use virtual assistants.   There is a glossary at the end of each lesson that reviews the terms that were introduced to help you learn the vocabulary to talk about programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons in this course are concise.  The less mental time it takes to read the lessons, the more capacity you will have for programming.  Use it.  You can't learn to program just by reading a book, or watching a video, or letting a virtual assistant do it for you -- you have to practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read carefully and work on exercises consistently, you will make progress.  But take note -- learning to program is not easy, and even for experienced programmers it can be frustrating.  Just like relying on a boat to keep you afloat will not help you learn to swim, relying on virtual assistants to write code for you will not help you learn to code.  Throughout the course, there are suggested strategies to help you write correct programs and fix incorrect ones with the help of, not the reliance on, virtual assistants and artificial intelligence tools.\n"

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "For most programming languages, including Python, there are many tools you can use to write and run programs. \n",
    "These tools are called integrated development environments (IDEs).\n",
    "In general, there are two kinds of IDEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some work with files that contain code, so they provide tools for editing and running these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others work primarily with notebooks, which are documents that contain text and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, I recommend starting with a notebook development environment like Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks for this book are available from an online repository at <https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can download the notebooks and run them on your own computer. In that case, you have to install Python and Jupyter, which is not hard, but if you want to learn Python, it can be frustrating to spend a lot of time installing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An alternative is to run the notebooks on Colab, which is a Jupyter environment that runs in a web browser, so you don't have to install anything. Colab is operated by Google, and it is free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just getting started, I strongly recommend you start with Colab."
