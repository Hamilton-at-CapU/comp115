    "## Who Is This Course For?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is for people who have never programmed before.  Python is both one of the best programming languages for beginners and has been ranked the most popular coding language by the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) since 2022.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program now is probably easier than ever.  With virtual assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini, you have help at your fingertips whenever you need it.  However, just like relying on a boat to keep you afloat will not help you learn to swim, relying on virtual assistants to write code for you will not help you learn to code.  Throughout this course, you'll learn ways to use these tools to accelerate your learning, but this will require diligence on your part to ensure you are not becoming overly reliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of learning to program is that you have to learn *two* languages: one is the programming language itself; the other is the vocabulary we use to talk about programs.\n",
    "If you learn only the programming language, you are likely to have problems when you need to interpret an error message, read documentation, talk to another person, or use virtual assistants.   There is a glossary at the end of each lesson that reviews the terms that were introduced to help you learn the vocabulary to talk about programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons in this course are concise.  The less time it takes to read the lessons, the more time you will have for programming.  Use it.  You can't learn to program just by reading a book, watching a video, or letting a virtual assistant do it for you -- you have to practice.  If you read carefully and work on exercises consistently, you will make progress.  But take note -- learning to program is not easy, and even for experienced programmers it can be frustrating.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program means learning a new way to think.  So in addition to learning Python, this course will help you think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas -- specifically computations. Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions."

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "For most programming languages, including Python, there are many tools you can use to write and run programs. These tools are called **integrated development environments (IDEs)**.  In general, there are two kinds of IDEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Code Editors* work with files that contain code. They provide tools for editing and running these files.  [Thonny](thonny.org), [PyCharm](www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and [VSCode](code.visualstudio.com/) are examples of code editor IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Notebook Editors*, work with documents that contains code and text.  You can read a notebook like a book, but you can also run the code, modify it, and develop new programs.  The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is the most common notebook format for Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, the notebook development environment is typically easier to get started.  While it is possible to run notebooks on your own computer it is typically easier to run the notebooks in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  Colab is a Jupyter environment that runs in a web browser, so you don't have to install anything. Colab is operated by Google and is free to use, but does require a Google account.  You may use your personal Google account (if you have one), or set one up specifically for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this notebook on Colab, you should see an orange logo in the upper left that looks like the letters `CO`.  If you are not running this notebook in Colab, you should see an `Open in Colab` button at the top of the page.\n"
